# Around the Block

Capture. Share. Discover. <b>Around the Block</b> is a web application that allows a user to pin photos around their neighborhood to the specific locations on the map and view what others have shared as well. 

Once the user signs in, they will be able to visit their profile page to directly upload photos on the map, generated by the Google Maps API. The user can look up a specific location using the Google Places search bar or use the Geocoder button to bring the map to their current location. From there, the user can place a marker on the map, click on the marker, and add a photo in the popup window. Once the photo is submitted, they can view it any time. The user can also visit the map page to view markers and photos shared by other users (retrieved from AWS S3).

This application uses React Dropzone, Combobox, and Foundation as well.
