# Around the Block

As we have all been stuck inside during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become so important for us to take the time to go outside, breathe fresh air, and walk around. As someone who recently moved to a new neighborhood, I also realized itâ€™s a great opportunity to explore my immediate neighborhood, you know, around the block. That's what led me to build my personal project <b>Around the Block</b>.

Around the Block is a photo sharing web app that allows a user to pin photos around their neighborhood to the specific locations on the map and explore what others have shared as well. As demonstrated above, it allows a user to seamlessly upload photos directly within the Google Maps marker windows and immediately view it!

A signed in user can view and share photos by visiting the Map page, generated by the Google Maps API. The user can then look up a specific location using the Google Places search bar or use the Geolocation button to bring the map to their current location. From there, the user can place a marker on the map, click on the marker, and add a photo in the popup window. Once the photo is submitted, they can immediately access it from the same marker. The user can also explore markers and photos shared by other users (retrieved from AWS S3) and save the photos to the My Photos page by clicking the heart button. In the My Photos page, the user will be able see the infinite scroll list of photos taken by them and list of liked photos, along with the corresponding markers on their personal map. 

This application uses React Dropzone, Combobox, Ant Design, and Foundation as well.
